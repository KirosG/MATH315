# Class Logistics
There was a survey done in Week 1 where I asked you to tell me what more you wanted to know regarding how this class is run and what is expected out of you? Here is a compilation of those responses. As more come in I will add to this list. 

* I have no background in programing and I think it would be very interesting to learn.Even in my biol 350 class, Fundamentals of Ecology, R programing was mentioned. I would like to know more about how to install R. I believe I did it correctly but not all the different consoles are coming up on mine like they showed in the video.
    - **I belive you are talking about the windows in R Studio. That may be because when you first open R by itself, you do not have a script or code file open yet. You can see more about this on my software overview [[blog post]](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/)**
* I am not familiar with R studio. Will we be able to go through codes and other problems in class together?
    - **Yes. The videos and the course notes demonstrate how to write code to accomplish a specific task. In class we will work through how the code works, then you will work with your group to apply a code concept to a new problem.**
* I want to know more about writing code in general and what R language is. 
    - **From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))** 
    
> R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

* How straongly do you recommend the R bootcamp before taking  or alongside this class? First and one of the only stats classes I'll be taking with my major.
    - **That R Bootcamp (MATH 130) was designed specifically as a primer for R before taking MATH 315. It is a new course, this fall is it's first official run as MATH 130. I am working with other NS departments and faculty members to advise their students to take this course prior to 315. You can be successfull taking it concurrently as well. The more exposure to R you have early on the more comfortable you will be.**
* There are different assignments due on the blackboard calender due date page vs the course website weekly outline. Which do we follow ?
    - **Please let me know via email any discrepencies. Items that are due to be submitted to Blackboard should have the exact same due date. There are more items listed in the weekly overview (such as reading) that do not have a corresponding submission link in Blackboard, because there is nothing to submit.**
* I would like to know about how many suggested hours will we need outside of class in order to do well. Also, will it be a big barrier if we do not have a laptop to take to class.
    - **Every student I have spoken to says that having your own laptop makes this class easier. While we do have loaner laptops for use in class, you cannot check them out. So you must bring a flash drive to save all your work and data files on.**
* My confusion always comes from the assignments are located, how to access them , and how to turn them in.
    - **Links to download assignment instructions, and RMD template files are found on the weekly overview for that day. (Not the daily grid, but the more detailed page where you can navigate to each day using the menu bar on the left).**
    - **Assignments will nearly always be uploaded to Blackboard Learn**
* I'm a bit unclear of what to expect from this class. In high school we covered things such as chi squared test and I am curious if we will be going over equations like that or if this class will simply be mainly coding.
    - **We will be talking about some equations, but we will not be doing hand calculations that you may have done in HS. Our goal is to analyze real data using tests like the $\chi^2$ test, and focusing on how to interpret the results.**
* will you give us cumulative exams?
    - **Yes in the sense that you can't explain a more advanced result without knowing the basics first.** 
* A have a few questions/concerns about this course. 
    1. How much time is expected to be spent practicing using R outside of class/doing homework in order to get an A?
        - **The general rule of thumb is 3 hours of workload outside of class for every 1 hour in class. This means you are expected to spend 9 hours doing work for this class. How fast you pick up on the R language will impact this time, but the assignments have been strucutred such that learning R should not dramatically increase your workload. The important thing is while you're learning R, to try to learn why something works, not just copy/paste/pray. That way you can apply it to a new problem with minimal errors.**
    2. For the group work, are we also graded by our own contributions or just our work as a whole?
        - **I intend to assign the same grade to both individuals in the pair.**
* Will credit still be given to those who try to code and still fail?
    - **I can't say yes here, because your ability to generate analysis results requires successful code.**
* Will i need to download any additional programs for the class
    - **The only required programs for this class are R and R Studio. Latex is highly recommended/preferred. **
