# Evaluation Rubric

If you are a part of my class then rest assured your poster will be evaluated by me, and the rest of the class. [Here]() is the grading rubric that I use. 

# Structure

### Template
* Build your poster using a powerpoint template, not Google Slides. 
* Choose either a three, or four column layout. 
* Find out how large of a poster you need to have and make sure 

### Sections
1. Abstract/introduction
2. Sample characteristics
    - Table 1
3. Analysis methods
4. Results
5. Conclusions/discussion
6. Implications
7. References


# Aestetics

### Font size

### Graphics

### Tables
* Build them in Excel, or powerpoint tables directly


### Colors
* Colors are good - but stick to a theme/pallet. 
    - Make the colors meaningful
* Use matching theme colors in graphics

# Printing
* Don't spend a fortune! (i.e. don't go to Kinkos on Mangrove and spend $90)
* Metagraphcs $50 36x48 --still pricey
* Ellis Art (downtown and on Esplanade) $30
* Staples ($65)
* Kinkos downtown, B&W $10

# Examples
Here are a few example posters from various locations. 

* My [[personal publications]]()
* [College of Natural Sciences Poster Session](http://www.csuchico.edu/nsci/poster-session). This page also contains guidance for how to build a good poster. The link at the bottom will take you to last year's winners. 
* Previous [MATH 315]() classes
* Previous [MATH 615]() classes
