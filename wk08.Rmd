# Friday: Exam 2

## Prepare
* Review the [sample exam](docs/Sample_Exam_2.pdf)
* Go through your course reader and make sure you've filled out all the questions and examples. 

##### Assigments
* Error Assessment (Optional)
    - Take your returned exam and go over it carefully. 
    - Print out [this form](docs/error_assessment.pdf) and use it to understand what types of mistakes you are making. 
    - Correct your exam on a new piece of paper. 
    - Go over your returned exam with a tutor, with a specific eye towards what _type_ of mistakes you made. **Do not go to a tutor until you have made your own corrections**
    - Have the tutor sign off on your visit. 

You can earn up to half credit of the total missed points back by returning the form, corrected work and exam back to me by 10/6.
