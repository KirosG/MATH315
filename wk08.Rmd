# Monday: 
Goals: 

* Use R to conduct 1 sample tests for a mean and a proportion

## Prepare 
* Download the following data files and store in your `MATH315/Data` folder. (_You may already have the email data set. You do not need to redownload it._) 
    - [Age at Marriage]()
    - [Email]()
* Download the following [Ch5_Notes.Rmd](docs/Ch5_notes.Rmd) code file and store in your `MATH315/Code` folder. 
    - Open this and knit to make sure it works before class. 
    - **We cannot spend time in class waiting for you to fix your problems loading data. You WILL fall behind.**


## In class
* Walk through Chapter 5 examples in class.

# Wednesday:
Goals: 

* Conduct 1 sample t-tests on a categorical and continuous variables from YOUR research questions variables from Add Health. 

## Prepare
* Start a new RMD file called `One_Sample_Analysis.Rmd`. Read in the `addhealth_clean.Rmd` data set
* Make sure you have a binary categorical variable ready on your AddHealth Data set.
    - This should be the same one that you used for the Foundation worksheet
    - This must be a 0/1 indicator variable
    - You may have to modify and then rerun your `addhealth_dm.Rmd` data management file to get this variable. 
        - Never fear! As long as you have been saving your data as `addhealth_clean.Rmd` at the end of your DM file the rest of your code in other documents will still work! Long live reproducibility!
    
## In class

* Confirm your hand-written analysis results on the Founations worksheet by running the tests in R. 
* Open analysis project work time. 
* Exam 2 questions?

# Friday: Exam 2

## Prepare
* Review the [sample exam](docs/Sample_Exam_2.pdf)
* Go through your course reader and make sure you've filled out all the questions and examples.
* Complete your [Foundations for Inference](docs/Foundations Worksheet.pdf) worksheet. A blank one is linked in case you would like to reprint. 
* Setting the stage. [This document](docs/Setting_the_Stage.pdf) is a set of student generated questions from previous semesters. You will have an opportunity to add to this list. 
    - A good study technique would be to rephrase some of these questions as testable hypotheses. 
    - Contributions including rephrasing/reworking/editing for typos and/or clarity that are submitted to me (via email) will be greatly appreciated, and added to the document. 

* Error Assessment (Optional)
    - Take your returned exam and go over it carefully. 
    - Print out [this form](docs/error_assessment.pdf) and use it to understand what types of mistakes you are making. 
    - Correct your exam on a new piece of paper. 
    - Go over your returned exam with a tutor, with a specific eye towards what _type_ of mistakes you made. **Do not go to a tutor until you have made your own corrections**
    - Have the tutor sign off on your visit. 

You can earn up to half credit of the total missed points back by returning the form, corrected work and exam back to me by 10/27.
