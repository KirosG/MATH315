## Setup
1. Read in AddHealth data 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
load("J:/MATH315/Project/addhealth_clean.Rdata")
```

2. Pick 1 binary categorical and 1 continuous variable to work with. Replace `X` and `Y` below with your choices. 
3. Ensure R agrees that your chosen variables are what you think they should be. 


* Binary categorical variable: X
* Continuous variable: Y

```{r}
is(addhealth$X)
is(addhealth$Y)
```

## Point Estimates (Section 4.2)
1. Calculate the sample proportion for your binary variable. 




2. Calculate the mean for your continuous variable. 





## Confidence Intervals (Section 4.5)





## Hypothesis Testing using R (Section 5.1)
