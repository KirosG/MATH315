## Coursework

There are 6 types of assignments that I use to help you learn, and to assess how well you have
learned the material and can synthesize information. These categories are listed below, somewhat 
ordered in roughly how prompt the feedback is (Top:immediate, Bottom: approx 1 week)

1. **BBLearn**: Quizzes typically worth 1 point on Blackboard Learn. 
      - These are a random set of questions from a pool of questions. 
      - You have unlimited attempts to earn the score you desire. 
      - Late submissions are accepted until EOD of the day before the upcoming exam. 
2. **R**: You will spend a fair amount of time on Data Camp learning R. 
      - There will be a corresponding BBLearn learn quiz associated with each lesson. 
      - You will have multiple (but not unlimited) attempts at these quizes. 
      - Questions can be conceptual, interpreting results, and asking you to write code to demonstrate a task. 
      - The corresonding DC labs range in difficulty and length, so the points per assignment will range from 5-10. 
3. **Learning**: These types of assignments are all designed to help you become aware of how you learn 
    and how you can become a more active learner. 
      - Learning assignments take the form of readiness assurance tests, team preparation, 
      Exam error assessments and meta-cognition assessments and reading. 
4. **Exams:** There will be 3 exams. 
      - An Error Analysis can be conducted on Exam 1 and 2 to earn back up to half the credit missed. 
5. **Written**: Includes problem sets from the course notes, and in-class worksheets. 
      - Typically be submitted as either code files or compiled PDF/Word/HTML documents.
      - These will take a considerable amount of time writing and are worth 5-10 pts. 
      - The solutions are posted to the course website after the due date. 
      - See comment about late homework below. 
6. **Project:** You will be working in pairs on a project throughout the term. 
      - There will be several check in points
      - You will present your work as a poster at the end of the semester. 
    
  
**Late work:** 

* Written homework is due via Blackboard Learn every Sunday end of day (EOD). This means midnight. 
* Late work and resubmission for assignments earning 0 pts will be accepted until EOD day before exam, 
  for at most half credit. These are then not graded for correctness, just effort and completeness. 
 
 
## Grading

* Your final grade will be a straight sum of points earned and will be displayed as a running total in Blackboard Learn. 
* The approximate contributions per category are: BBLearn, Reading, Learning, R are combined worth about 25\%, Written assignments 25\%, Exams 25\%, and the project 25\%. 
* I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90\%: A, 89-80\%: B, 79-70\%: C, 69-60\%: D, 0-59\%: F Plusses and minuses will be as displayed on Blackboard Learn. 





# Schedule of Topics

A more detailed schedule that is updated weekly can be found on the course website. The general ordering of topics is:

* Data Collection and recording
* Preparing data for analysis
* Data Visualization
* Foundations for Inference: Random variables, Parameters vs. Statistic, Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing
* Inference for a single sample (t-tests, $\chi^{2}$ tests)
* Inference comparing multiple samples (t-tests, ANOVA, $\chi^{2}$ tests)
* Linear regression analysis (Simple and Multiple, Categorical predictors and contrasts)


## Adding and Dropping the course
The last day to drop or add a course is 9/15/17. After this date, withdraws will only be allowed for serious and compelling reasons subject to department chair approval.

## Americans with Disabilities Act
