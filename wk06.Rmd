# Monday: 
Goals: 


## Prepare

* Read: Writing about empirical research [[HTML]](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/lec_writing_em/)

## In class

Notes

  * What is the difference between a research plan and an empirical paper? 
      - RP has title, introduction, methodology, predicted results, implications, and references
      - Something to start constructing now piece by piece so you are ready to turn it in in about 3 weeks
  * Purpose is to develop a blueprint of what you are going to do and expect outcomes so you have a guide
      - Won’t do predicted results
      - EP has actual results and a full discussion
  * You will put this in a poster form at the end of the semester
  * Hourglass shape – Broad to specific, specific to broad



##### Assignments
* Research plan outline [[HTML instructions]](hw/research_plan_outline.html)
