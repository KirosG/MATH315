# Monday: Data Management
Goals: 


## Prepare 
* Watch PDS Video 7
* Replicate all code in the [[Data prep]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/docs/lec02_data_prep.html) lecture notes. 
    - Some of these techniques to clean data take a different approach than what you will see in the PDS Video 7. That is fine!
    - There are many different ways to approach and solve a problem. Being exposed to multiple ways of how to do things may seem confusing, but not everyone     thinks the same. 
    - Some approaches may work better for some than for others. As you grow in being a scientist in charge of your own data you will find your own style of     coding.
