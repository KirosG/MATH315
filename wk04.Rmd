# Monday: Data Management
Goals: 

* Understand why data preparation takes the majority of your time, but is crucially important. 
* Learn how to be the boss of your own data. 
    - changing integers to factors
    - recoding missing data and skip patterns
    - subsetting, filtering, aggregating, summarizing, sorting. 


## Prepare 
* Watch PDS Video 7
* Download the `dplyr` lab [[RMD file]](docs/dplyr.Rmd). This is another approach to data cleaning that can seem more intuitive for some tasks.
    - Check to see if you have the `dplyr`, `nycflights13` and `hflights` packages installed by trying to load the `library()`. 

## In class

* Data manipulation with `dplyr`. Live coding follow-along example. 

## Additional Resources
* MATH 456/615 [[Data prep]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/docs/lec02_data_prep.html) lecture notes.
