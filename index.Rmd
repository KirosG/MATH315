# Announcements

### 9/21/17 - Week 6
I have gone through the gradebook and entered in 0's for missing assignments to date. This is done to provide you a better idea of where you stand grade-wise, going into this exam. Quizzes will remain open available up until the test on the 27th. So if you got a 0 on a Problem set or Data Camp quiz you have time to make up those points. This is also a good way to study for the exam. 


* Monday: Writing your research plan. 
* Wednesday: Exam 1. The weekly overview has details on how to prepare and a sample exam. 
* Friday: Probability. If it's been a while since you've had stats class you will have to spend some significant time preparing. 

### 9/18/17 - Week 5
* Recap the DM assignment template/instructions. 
* Univariate graphics assignment due this week. This is a peer reviewed assignment. Example template posted on [week 4](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/wk04.html).
* Peer review instructions have been added to the project page. 
* Monday we will lecture on how to interpret bivariate comparisons. The rest of the week you will work on creating them. 



### 9/11/17 - Week 4
* Data Management, Graphing and Research Question Sharing, Oh My!
* You should have been watching and following along with the PDS videos for about a week now. If you are not, do this ASAP or you will fall behind. Think of these as lecture, and in class as practice time. 
* You Research questions are posted on [[THIS GOOGLE SPREADSHEET]](https://docs.google.com/a/mail.csuchico.edu/spreadsheets/d/17KyM74omyRXPa322ieiU0iv-hjiO7THhAD5TVkI1qgo/edit?usp=sharing)
    - You must log in with your @mail.csuchico.edu email address to view and edit this file. 
    - I have copied your RQ's as stated in your personal codebook assignment, and demonstrated how to take the variables chosen in the codebook, and align them with specific RQ's. 
    - **I need you to help finish and/or adjust your entry!** 
    - This is your opportunity to 
        - see what others are doing
        - find out who is using the same variables as you
        - Align your RQ with actual variables in the codebook. 
* The Project information page has been started. The link to the spreadsheet above is the first piece of info there. 
    

### 9/3/17 - Week 3

* Have a great three day weekend!
* We're going to be learning how to describe the distribution of data using words, summary statistics and appropriate graphics.
* This is your last chance to get all your R/R Studio bugs resolved. Next week we're hitting the coding ground hard. 
* Be sure you're watching the PDS Videos. They contain lecture material directly related to your project. 

### 8/27/17 - Week 2

This week we're going to be talking about data, doing some data entry and importing data into R.
You'll start to choose specific variables to address your research questions, conduct a literature review, and learn how to properly cite your sources.

* Monday
    - RAT on data types (CN 2.1)
    - Practice recording raw data and creating a codebook
